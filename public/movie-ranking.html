<h1>The Best Movies According to Tanzim</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr /> 
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
   <p>This is my favorite of all time. It added gas to the pre-existing flames in me for my future in a STEM environment. </p>
<h3>The Dark Knight Rises</h3>
   <p>Although such answers to these questions are subjective, I think that objectively this is the greatest movie made for men who are losing the battle with themselves in regards to primal spirit. </p>

<h3>Oppenheimer</h3>
   <p>This movie really shows the importance of what STEM majors have done in the past to make the world we know of today.</p>
